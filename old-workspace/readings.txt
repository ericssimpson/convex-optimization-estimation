Notes:
Perhaps it may not be feasible? 
Is there such "underlying function" to all linear programs (and perahps even of non-linear programs) such that they may be solved or atleast estimated instantanesouly?
Could this be related to an NP Problem? Could I use this to predict if a program halts or not?
No I don't think so, since linear programs either have either have one solution, many solutions, or no solutions.
The detection of many solutions should be intuitive no, as one could have an algorithm, when learned to classify (and find) the optimal solution, could one generalize this?
As to "graph" (as much as graphing allows in n-dimensional spaces) and premptivly solve the problem, which would then be used to train the evoluation algorithms.
Perhaps then you could even vary the paremeters, and then have a multi-armed approach to selecting the model with the best reward expecation (or in other words highest safe accuracy [meaning the feasible search space which is constrained and does not enter the in feasible region and contains the optimal point]).
Which then we would vary the problems and dimensions, hopefully arriving at a model which may instantly evaluate linear programs like we do with two dimensional linear programs with a cost vector (we certainly don't interate over every basic feasible solution until we arrive at the optimal feasible solution).
